# The GitHub organization

## Goals

The [`salt-extensions` GitHub organization](gh-org-ref) was established in light of the [Great Module Migration](great-migration-ref) to:

1. Provide users with a central hub for all kinds of Salt modules.
2. Offer developers and contributors a streamlined development experience.
3. Coordinate efforts during the module migration process.
